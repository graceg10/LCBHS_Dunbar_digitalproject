## About the Collection: 
Generated by the Lee County Black History Society that was founded in 1994 by Janice Cass, the Lee County Black History Society collection consists of news articles, photographs and documents that highlight a variety of high school memorabilia and other special events, achievements and celebrations. The Lee County Black History Society is in Fort Myers, Florida, and has been in partnership with Florida Gulf Coast University Archives and Special Collections. The collection also includes oral histories from African Americans who recounted their lived experiences in Lee County. These oral histories mark not just African American identity, but it also brings attention to the daily lives of the African American community.
